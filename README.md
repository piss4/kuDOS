# kuDOS
kuDOS is an open source DOS-like terminal made in C.
You can use kuDOS for anything you'd like!
kuDOS is currently in alpha and isn't even close to completion! There currently aren't many commands yet but you are free to create your own by modifying the source code.
kuDOS is compatible with any operating system, but runs best on *nix & Linux.

# Installation

## Windows
Simply clone this repository and that's it! kuDOS.exe is the compiled executable version of kuDOS for Windows. kuDOS.c (in the Windows directory) is the source code for the Windows compatible version of kuDOS.

## *nix & Linux
Clone this repository (using git) into whichever directory you desire. Open the *nix directory in the terminal and enter ``chmod +0777 kuDOS.out``. Then use ``./kuDOS.out`` to use kuDOS. kuDOS.out is the compiled executable version of kuDOS for *nix and Linux based operating systems. kuDOS.c (in the *nix directory) is the source code for kuDOS.
